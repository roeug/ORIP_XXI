The following software combination is used to build Windows binary:
Delphi 5 Professional + RX library 2.75 (with the latest patches installed)
GNU Compiler Collection Windows port GCC-2.95.2 for Mingw (i386-mingw32) 

Attention !!!
Delphi 5 configuration files are corresponded with IDE local settings (LIB paths, etc.)
Some comments are in Russian or RussEnglish.
Some units are included in USES statements of PAS-files 
but in fact, at the moment not used (but necessary for compiler).
Unit UnitDM_DAO, in fact, is void. Some years ago DAO was used to Access MS MDB file.
