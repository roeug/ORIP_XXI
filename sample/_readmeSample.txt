NKE, ChainFinder, and ChainSolver are interactive codes with user input

There are some sample files for Tc transmutation problem in neutron flux (for ChainSolver):
Tc.chn - The transmutation chain (build with ChainSolver)
Tc.ivl - The initial values
Tc.pow - The reactor shchedule
Tc.mm  - The mixed moderator data
Tc.om  - The outer (external) moderator data
Tc.rtb - The resonance shielding factor table (build with ChainSolver)
Tc.xls - Output excel file (build with ChainSolver)
